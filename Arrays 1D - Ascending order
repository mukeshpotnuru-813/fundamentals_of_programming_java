Kailash and his daughter Keerthana were arguing about who is the smartest person in the family. Kailash who is a world-known Computer Engineer asked Keerthana who has not yet completed college to write a program to sort the given array in ascending order. Can you help Keerthana?

Input Format

Input consists of 1 integer and 1 array. The integer corresponds to the size of the array.

Constraints

NA

Output Format

The output consists of an array of elements after sorting.

Sample Input 0

5
54
68
25
14
74
Sample Output 0

The Sorted array is:
14
25
54
68
74
Sample Input 1

4
6
7
8
3
Sample Output 1

The Sorted array is:
3
6
7
8
Explanation 1

Here we can compare the 1st value(6)with all the other values,6 is greater than 3 and hence 6 will get printed in the second position. 
Repeat the same process for all the remaining values to get the output in sorted order.

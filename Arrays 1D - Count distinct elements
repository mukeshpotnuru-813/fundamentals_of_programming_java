Harish and Rajesh were developing a plan to find the ideal woman for Sheldon Cooper. There were puzzles, translations, and questions to check a person's intelligence. One such question was to come up with a program to count the number of distinct elements in an array. Harini is a postdoctoral researcher and a former graduate student of Caltech who is a huge fan of Sheldon's work and she wanted to impress Sheldon by writing a program to count the number of distinct element in an array. Can you help Harini?

Input Format

Input consists of 1 integer and 1 array. The first integer corresponds to the size of the array.

Constraints

NA

Output Format

The output prints the number of distinct element in an array.

Sample Input 0

5
1

4
Sample Output 0

There are 4 distinct element in the array.
Explanation 0

Since there are 4 distinct elements it will print There are 4 distinct element in the array.

Input Format

Input consists of 1 integer and 1 array. The first integer corresponds to the size of the array. The next integers correspond to the elements in the array.

Constraints

NA

Output Format

The output consists of an array with no duplicate elements.

Sample Input 0

5
1
2
2
3
4
Sample Output 0

1
2
3
4
Explanation 0

Here, among the array elements, 1 is repeated twice, removing the duplicate ones we can print the remaining array elements. Hence the output is 1 5

Sample Input 1

           int k=-1;
           for(int j=0;j<i;j++){
               if(a[j]==a[i]){

           }
            if(k==-1){
                System.out.println(a[i]);
            }
        }
    }
